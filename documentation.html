	<p class="description_documentation">Liked is a two-part project addressing anxieties triggered by the use of social media. There is often a pressure to maintain a picture-perfect image on social media platforms, yet getting caught up in the act of scrolling causes the negligence of the actual content. The first part is a Chrome extension which disrupts the usual flow of liking posts on Instagram. After liking a post, the user experiences an atypical response to their action. The response can be one of the following:</p>
		<p class="description_tab">- A text appears on top of the picture, i.e., ‘Did you really see this picture?’, ‘How many pictures have you already liked?’.
		<br>
		<br>
		- A comment appears to have been posted from the user’s account, while also deleting existing comments. One comment is posted at a time, i.e., ‘Why did you post this?’, ‘Not actually sure why I liked it’.
		<br>
		<br>
		- The like count disappears revealing a message saying that the user has erased all the likes. The message appears to have been posted from the user’s account, using their username.
		<br>
		<br>
		-Nothing unusual happens, in order to keep the element of surprise.</p>
	<p class="description">The user is caught off guard when they notice these responses happen. The responses prompt the user to stop and think more about the content that they engage with as well how their username’s unexpected appearance under someone’s post affects them.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		The extension is available for download <a class="link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liked/fgfddnbpdccindgicnfbfcijikbaffeg/null" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p class="description">The second part is an Internet café and modern co-working culture inspired exhibition space which reflects on the modern social media culture and the phenomenon of circulationism. I was inspired by the Internet café concept because it is a place that people used to go to seek privacy and anonymity in the online world, while being in a public space. I think it is a relatable metaphor for our social media presence nowadays, as we are hidden behind a layer of anonymity with our curated social media platforms, yet at the same time our data and privacy is as exposed as ever. Similarly, in a modern trendy café it is all about appearances and how one looks in the eyes of others – whether in real life and especially on social media.
			<br>
			<br>
		Although the exhibition could not physically take place due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, I developed the design elements that would have gone in the exhibition, in order to be able to recreate the space in the future. I created renders for the room which includes a co-working countertop with laptops, an “instagrammable” wall and decorations often seen in contemporary aesthetic cafés such as pendant lamps, wall shelves, many plants, mugs, etc.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="description">The "instagrammable" wall art consists of dark clouds representing anxiety caused my social media presence and millennial pink hearts which represent the millennial online culture and how caught up one might get in the idea of 'likes' and 'liking'.
			<br>
			<br>
		I also created a logo and a brochure for the exhibition which is in a form of a menu to be in line with the café theme of the space. Both the logo and the brochure consists of line art accompanied with soft texture pink hearts to keep a balance between minimalistic graphics and trends in the social media world.</p>

		<p class="description">Lastly I created a set of pink stickers. They were supposed to be given out to each person who enters the exhibition café space with instructions to physically put them on objects in the café, such as laptops, coffee cups, plants and other decorations. The idea is to try to represent liking that occurs on social media in real life and emphasize the absurdness if, for example, one object gets less “likes” than another similar object.</p>
