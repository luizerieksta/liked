		<p class="description">During the break I continued polishing the design elements such as the logo, the brochure and the Instagram background wall. The goal was to make them more unified because thus far the line art of the logo was not entirely consistent with the softer pink textures inside the brochure. Therefore, I incorporated the pink squiggly hearts within the logo and made the inside of the brochure use more of the line graphic style from the logo. At this point I am mostly done with the design elements and can concentrate on the rest of the tasks. I also updated this archive/documentation website to be in line with the new design. Now that it is up and working, I will be posting the weekly updates here as well as start the documentation of my project.</p>

		<p class="description">Regarding the direction the project will take after the announcement about not being able to do a physical exhibition, I have decided to fully move my project online. After consulting with my advisor we pinpointed two main reasons for this decision. Firstly, the extension itself is already online and can exist fully in an online medium without any additional changes. Secondly, it is not possible anymore to fabricate the assets needed for a physical exhibition. Without assets such as the countertop, the walls and even a real window it seemed like the essence of the interior design was lost. Besides, as there would be no people able to attend the temporary mounted exhibition in the Capstone studio at NYUAD, it also would not be possible to get physical participation in the space which was essential for such activities as taking photos of the Instagram wall or putting heart stickers on objects in the space.
		<br>
		<br>
		However, I am still very much attached to the idea of the Instagram caf√© and the design that I had planned. As I already had most of the design elements finished prior to the announcement about the exhibition, I would still like to use them, just in a different form. The solution that I came up with is creating some high quality 2d renders of what the exhibition space was supposed to look like and create a detailed guide of the space within the documentation section of this website. The documentation would include all the digital assets and renders of the space with a purpose to be able to recreate such a space at a time when making physical exhibitions is possible again. Therefore, it was important to work on this website over the break as it will become the main place where my Capstone project will live.</p>
